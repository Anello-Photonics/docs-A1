Anello EVK Developer Manual
============================

The Anello A-1 EVK is an easy to use high-accuracy navigation system that provides a convenient way 
to evaluate the exclusive benefits of Anello’s low-drift optical gyro technology.  System designers 
use the EVK system to begin design for the high-precision Anello SiPhOG :sup:`TM` sensor.  The EVK system
also serves as a truth reference system for difficult environment driving scenarios such as dense urban 
canyon environments.
