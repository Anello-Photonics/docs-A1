ANELLO Developer Manual
============================

The ANELLO EVK is an easy to use high-accuracy navigation system that provides a convenient way 
to evaluate the exclusive benefits of Anelloâ€™s low-drift optical gyro technology. System designers 
use the EVK system to begin design for the high-precision Anello SiPhOG :sup:`TM` sensor. The EVK system
also serves as a truth reference system for difficult environment driving scenarios such as dense urban 
canyon environments.

On May 22, 2022 the ANELLO announced the availability of the GNSS INS as a ruggedized volume product version of the ANELLO EVK.
