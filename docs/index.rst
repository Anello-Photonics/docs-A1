ANELLO Developer Manual Launch Page
====================================

ANELLO has developed a patented silicon photonics integrated circuit that replaces the discrete optical components (couplers, modulators, and detector) found in a FOG. The integrated SiPhOGâ„¢ provides a massive reduction in component costs and significant reduction in dimensional volume as compared to an equivalent high performance traditional Fiber Optic Gyro implementation.
