Known Issues and Limitations
==============================

Please see below for a list of known issues and limitations, and contact support@anellophotonics.com with any questions.

* The algorithm on the ANELLO GNSS INS and EVK is currently designed for wheeled land vehicles. Contact ANELLO about support for other vehicle types such as aerial and maritime vehicles.

* The CAN interface is not yet available. Please use the serial and ethernet interfaces and contact ANELLO for questions on future CAN availability.

* The ANELLO binary message does not work on units delivered before April 13, 2023. Please contact ANELLO for assistance if this is needed.

* The static dual antennae heading initialization feature is only available on units shipped after Nov 1, 2022 and with firmware version 1.0 or later. If you received your unit prior to this date and are interested in this feature, please contact ANELLO.

* Units with firmware versions before v1.1.3 may experience some timing jitter on IMU and INS timestamps. For improved timing performance, please contact ANELLO to upgrade to the latest firmware.

* Some minor timing jitter can be expected in the GPS, GP2, and HDG packets.
