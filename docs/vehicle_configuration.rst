Vehicle Configuration
==================================

The ANELLO EVK and GNSS INS products require vehicle configurations to be set for proper functionality. 

The easiest way to set ANELLO vehicle configurations is using the `ANELLO Python Program <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_tool.html#vehicle-configurations>`_, 
which saves all changes to non-volatile flash memory. 

Alternatively, the unit can be configured using the APVEH message, which allows for both temporary (RAM) and permanent setting (FLASH) of configuration parameters.

Vehicle Configuration Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vehicle configurations describe the positions of parts in the vehicle setup, which are used in the ANELLO algorithm. 
All positions are in meters, using the center of the ANELLO unit as the origin and using the coordinate system (X forward, Y right, Z down) 
in the vehicle frame, i.e. not corrected for mounting orientation of the unit.

+---------------------+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Lever Arm 1        |  g1x, g1y, g1z   |   Vector from center of ANELLO unit to antenna 1, in meters                      |
+---------------------+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Lever Arm 2        |  g2x, g2y, g2z   |   Vector from center of ANELLO unit to antenna 2, in meters                      |
+---------------------+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Rear Axle Center    |  cnx, cny, cnz   |   Vector from center of ANELLO unit to center of rear axle, in meters            |
+---------------------+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Output Center       |  ocx, ocy, ocz   |   Vector from center of ANELLO unit to desired INS solution position, in meters  |
+---------------------+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Antenna Baseline    |  bsl             |   Baseline length between two antennae, in meters                                |
+---------------------+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In order to use dual antenna heading, the antenna baseline must be calibrated using the ANELLO Python program. 
The options to enter an antenna baseline are as follows:

1. **Enter manually:** Enter baseline between center of antennae, in meters. This should only be used if you can measure this baseline in a CAD model within 2cm accuracy.
2. **Auto calibrate:** This is the recommended method. Mount antennae in desired position on vehicle, ensure your vehicle has full open sky view. The ANELLO unit will measure the baseline between the antennae to sub-2cm accuracy and save the antenna baseline configuration automatically.
3. **Calibrate from lever arms:** Similar to #1, this should only be used if you are certain of your lever arm measurements to sub-cm accuracy.

Mounting ANELLO Unit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The mounting location of the ANELLO EVK and GNSS INS is flexible and can be configured for various installation positions and orientations. 
For the least complexity, we recommendation mounting the unit above the center of the vehicleâ€™s rear axle with the X-Axis facing forward along the direction of travel.

   Default Installation Location

If the unit is oriented differently (e.g. backwards or upside down), the orientation must be configured using the ANELLO Python Program, 
see `Unit Configurations <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit_configuration.html>`_.

Antennae Mounting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The antennae provided with the ANELLO EVK magnetically mount to the vehicle roof. Alternative GNSS antennae can be 
used, as long as they support dual band and all constellations. Please avoid placing antennae on significantly curved surfaces 
or below obstructions which would reduce available sky view.

Units received after Nov 1, 2022 and with firmware version 1.0 or later will have dual antenna functionality. 
If you are on a firmware version lower than v1.2.0, ANT1 must be in the back and ANT2 in the front.
On firmware v1.2.0 and later, antennae can be positioned in any orientation on the vehicle. 
Either way, the antennae must be separated by at least 0.6 meters and accurate lever arms must be set.
Errors in the lever arm settings will directly cause errors in vehicle heading obtained by the GNSS INS antennae.

For best performance, it is recommended to orient both antennae in the same direction, and ensure there is a ground plane with a diameter of at least 10 cm (4 in).
Magnetic mounting to the roof of a car acts as an effective ground plane.

Odometer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For extended GNSS-denied testing, it is recommended to send odometer input (including both speed and direction) to the ANELLO EVK or GNSS INS. 
This can be done by sending an `APODO message <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/communication_messaging.html#apodo-message>`_ to the configuration port of the ANELLO unit.
A few recommended odometer options are:

1. If you have access to the vehicle CAN bus, you can read in the directional speed from the CAN bus to the computer used to connect to the EVK or GNSS INS. Then, construct and send the APODO message to the ANELLO unit.
2. An external wheel speed sensor can be installed on the vehicle. ANELLO recommends the Pegasem WSS, though it is not robust enough to suit rough terrains.
3. A radar odometer can be installed on the vehicle. ANELLO recommends the Pegasem GSS.

Supported Vehicle Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ANELLO algorithm is currently designed for wheeled land vehicles. 
Contact ANELLO about availability and support for other vehicle types such as aircraft/drones, marine vehicles, and tracked land vehicles.
