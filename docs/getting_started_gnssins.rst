GNSS INS Getting Started Guide
==================================
Thank you for choosing the ANELLO GNSS INS! This guide will get you started with connection, configuration and data collection.
Please contact support@anellophotonics.com with any questions.  

Hardware Connections
---------------------------------
The ANELLO GNSS INS unit is pictured below. It features a 20 pin automotive-grade Molex MX150 connector and two FAKRA SMB GNSS connectors.

If you received an ANELLO GNSS INS Loaner unit, you will also receive the Accessory Kit with the items pictured below. 
For GNSS INS purchases, the Accessory Kit is sold separately and more information is available upon request.

To use the GNSS INS Evaluation Kit, connect the hardware as follows: 

1. Connect breakout cable to GNSS INS unit
2. Connect to power using either the AC/DC adapter or the Auto Cable Plug.
3. Connect primary GNSS antenna to ANT1 using SMA to FAKRA Adapters. An additional antenna (ANT2) is optional and enables stationary dual heading.
4. Connect to computer via RS-232 using USB 2.0 to DB9 serial converters for configuration.
5. If you'd like to use the automotive ethernet interface, connection over serial is required first to configure IP addresses.

An SCD drawing of the GNSS INS and a schematic of the Accessory kit breakout cable can be found in 
`Mechanicals <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mechanicals.html#anello-imu-imu>`__.


Software Interfaces
---------------------------------
ANELLO provides a Python tool to connect, configure, and log data with the GNSS INS.
Please see instructions on `ANELLO Python Tool <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_tool.html>`__.

ANELLO units are also compatible with ROS using our C-based `ROS driver <https://github.com/Anello-Photonics/ANELLO_ROS_Driver>`_.

If you would like to connect to the GNSS INS using a serial interface software such as CoolTerm, 
please ensure you use the correct baud rate (default for the GNSS INS is 230400), and set Data Bits = 8, Stop Bits = 1, and Parity = None.

For a full list of software tools, please see `Software Tools <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/software_tools.html>`_.


Configure ANELLO GNSS INS
---------------------------------
Before testing your GNSS INS, please review the available configurations and ensure they are set according to your testing needs.
A description of ANELLO unit and vehicle configurations can be found at `Unit Configurations <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit_configuration.html>`_,
and `Vehicle Configurations <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vehicle_configuration.html>`_, respectively.

There are two options to change configurations:

Configure using ANELLO Python Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For unit configurations, select *Unit Configuration* from the main menu to see default configurations. To change a configuration, 
select *Edit*, then the configuration to change, then select or enter the new value.

For vehicle configurations, select *Vehicle Configuration* from the main menu and select *Edit*, to set the lever arms.

Note that as of firmware v1.2.0, to use dual antenna functionality, the antenna baseline must be calibrated. Please refer to 
`Vehicle Configurations <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vehicle_configuration.html>`_ to ensure all vehicle configurations are set properly.

Other Configuration Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may also send configurations manually over the GNSS INS's serial configuration port using a serial interface software, such as CoolTerm.


Connect to NTRIP Caster
------------------------------
Standard RTCM messages can be forwarded to the ANELLO GNSS INS data port to enable the GNSS receivers to reach RTK-level accuracy. 
The GNSS INS receives standard RTCM3.3 in MSM format, including MSM4, MSM5, and MSM7 messages. 

The ANELLO Python Program also provides an NTRIP client which can connect to a standard NTRIP network and forward the received RTCM messages into the GNSS INS.

From the main menu, select *NTRIP* and then *Start*. Enter the NTRIP caster details as prompted. 
The *System Status* will show the NTRIP connection status.


Vehicle Installation
----------------------------
The GNSS INS can be configured for various installation positions. To minimize configuration steps, 
mount near the center of the vehicleâ€™s rear axle, with the x-axis facing the direction of travel.

The GNSS antennae can be magnetically mounted on the roof of the vehicle.

Data Collection & Visualization
------------------------------------

Log Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To log data, you may use the ANELLO Python Tool, the ANELLO ROS driver, or another program of your choice.

To maximize ANELLO's ability to help analyze your data, we recommend logging data with the ANELLO Python Tool. Instructions can be found at 
`ANELLO Python Tool <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_tool.html#data-collection>`__.

Monitor Data Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For a real-time display of the ANELLO GNSS INS data, select *Monitor* in the main menu.

More information on the monitor window can be found at `ANELLO Python Tool <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_tool.html#monitor-output>`__.

Data Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INS solution can be visualized by importing ins.csv into `Kepler <https://kepler.gl/demo>`_.
You may also use a `CSV to KML converter <https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-kml.htm>`_ to visualize the results in Google Earth, 
but note that these tools often have data length limitations.


Drive Testing
-------------------
Before conducting drive testing, please review `Drive Testing Best Practices <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/drive_testing.html>`_ 
to ensure the system is set up properly, initializes smoothly, and is optimized for your use case.
