Please contact support@anellophotonics.com with any questions.  

1.) Hardware Connections
---------------------------------
The ANELLO Evaluation Kit (EVK) includes the following items:

    | 1 | ANELLO EVK                                     |
    +---+------------------------------------------------+
    | 2 | Two Dual-Band Multi-Constellation GNSS Antennae|
    +---+------------------------------------------------+
    | 3 | Power Cable                                    |
    +---+------------------------------------------------+
    | 4 | 110-240V AC Wall-Power Adapter                 |
    +---+------------------------------------------------+
    | 5 | International Wall-Power Plug Inserts          |
    +---+------------------------------------------------+
    | 6 | In-Vehicle Power Adapter                       |
    +---+------------------------------------------------+
    | 7 | USB Cable                                      |
    +---+------------------------------------------------+
    | 8 | Ethernet Cable                                 |
    +---+------------------------------------------------+

Connect the hardware as follows: 

a. Connect EVK to power using either the wall-power or the in-vehicle adapter (red).
b. Connect EVK to computer using USB-C (blue). Ethernet interface (green) is also available, but connection over serial is required first to configure IP addresses.
c. Connect primary GNSS antenna to ANT1 on the back of the EVK (black). An optional additional antenna (ANT2) enables stationary heading initialization.

For more information on hardware mechanicals, see `Mechanicals <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mechanicals.html#anello-evk>`_.


2). Software Interfaces
---------------------------------
ANELLO provides a Python tool to connect, configure, and log data with the EVK.
Please see instructions on `ANELLO Python Tool <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_tool.html>`__.

ANELLO units are also compatible with ROS using our C-based `ROS driver <https://github.com/Anello-Photonics/ANELLO_ROS_Driver>`_.

If you would like to connect to the EVK using a serial interface software such as CoolTerm, 
please ensure you use the correct baud rate (default for the EVK is 921600), and set Data Bits = 8, Stop Bits = 1, and Parity = None.

For a full list of software tools, please see `Software Tools <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/software_tools.html>`_.


3). Configure ANELLO EVK
---------------------------------
Before testing the ANELLO EVK, please review the `Unit Configurations <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit_configuration.html>`_,
and `Vehicle Configurations <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vehicle_configuration.html>`_ and ensure they are set according to your testing needs.

The easiest way to change configurations is using the `ANELLO Python Tool <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_tool.html#set-anello-configurations>`__.
Select *Unit Configuration* from the main menu. The default configurations will appear, and you can select *Edit* to change a configuration.

You may also send configurations manually using the `#APCFG command <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/communication_messaging.html#apcfg-messages>`_ 
over the EVK's configuration port using a serial interface software such as CoolTerm. Note that the configuration port on the EVK is the highest of the four virtual COM ports 
(more information at `Comminication & Messaging <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/communication_messaging.html>`_). 

.. note:: As of firmware v1.2.6, the antenna baseline must be calibrated to use dual antenna functionality. Please refer to `Vehicle Configurations <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vehicle_configuration.html>`_ to ensure all vehicle configurations are set properly.


4). Connect to NTRIP Caster
------------------------------
Standard RTCM messages can be forwarded to the ANELLO EVK data port to enable the GNSS receivers to reach RTK-level accuracy. 
The EVK receives standard RTCM3.3 in MSM format, including MSM4, MSM5, and MSM7 messages. 

The ANELLO Python Program also provides an NTRIP client which can connect to a standard NTRIP network and forward the received RTCM messages into the EVK.

From the main menu, select *NTRIP* and then *Start*. Enter the NTRIP caster details as prompted. 
The *System Status* will show the NTRIP connection status.

Corrections must be configured to the WGS84 coordinate frame. Our inertial navigation system assumes WGS84 as the reference coordinate system, and using a different coordinate frame may result in incorrect positioning and navigation data.


5). Vehicle Installation
----------------------------

The EVK can be configured for various installation positions. To minimize configuration steps, 
mount near the center of the vehicleâ€™s rear axle, with the x-axis facing the direction of travel.

   :width: 50 %
   :align: center

The GNSS antennae can be magnetically mounted on the roof of the vehicle.

Lever arm measurements and misalignment angles must be set to guarantee correct positioning data. See `Vehicle Configurations <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vehicle_configuration.html>`_ for calibration measurements and `Unit Configurations <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit_configuration.html>`_ for misalignment angles.

6). Data Collection & Visualization
------------------------------------

a). Log Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ANELLO Python Tool can be used to `log data <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_tool.html#data-collection>`__ from the ANELLO EVK
by selecting *Log* in the main menu. Alternatively, you may use the ANELLO ROS driver or another program of your choice to log data. 

b). Monitor Data Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ANELLO Python Tool can be used to `monitor data <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_tool.html#monitor-output>`__ 
from the ANELLO EVK in real-time by selecting *Monitor* in the main menu.

c). Data Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The INS solution can be visualized by importing ins.csv into `Kepler <https://kepler.gl/demo>`_.
You may also use a `CSV to KML converter <https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-kml.htm>`_ to visualize the results in Google Earth, 
but note that these tools often have data length limitations.


7). Drive Testing
-------------------
Before conducting drive testing, please review `Drive Testing Best Practices <https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/drive_testing.html>`_ 
to ensure the system is set up properly, initializes smoothly, and is optimized for your use case.
