ANELLO X3
---------------------------------
The ANELLO X3 features a 14 pin Molex Microfit 430451427 connector. **Note that if your X3 serial number is below 830, 
the unit will need to be mounted on the heat sinking mounting plate shipped with the unit. If removed from the plate, the X3 should NOT be mounted directly onto a thermal insulator such as plastic. It will need to be mounted directly to a thermally conductive surface or mounted such that convective air flow is allowed across all surfaces of the device. This is required to keep the internal temperatures below critical when operating environment is at the extreme of 50 Â°C.**

   If you purchased the X3 Evaluation Kit, a schematic of the breakout cable can be downloaded :download:`here <media/SCD_Breakout Cable_X3.pdf>`

.. note::
   Please note that the X3 SCD and breakout cable drawings reflect different use cases. The X3 SCD shows the raw pinout for direct connection to the X3, while the breakout cable includes a breakout board that reassigns certain pins (e.g., replacing unused SPI lines with additional grounds) for ease of use in an evaluation setting. This results in differing pin labels, but the overall functionality remains consistent.
